<p align="center">Gakumini is a mod that adds small additions to Minecraft that build up. Simple as that.</p>

### Current features:

- String recipe (grass or tall grass in any crafting slot gives 1 or 2 string, respectively)
- Saltpeter (a new resource that appears at -10 to -50 in the Overworld, or in the Nether. Fairly abundant.)
- Gunpowder recipe (requires charcoal, glowstone dust and saltpeter)
- Shields have a short cooldown after getting hit by anything (configurable with a gamerule).
  - Attacks that normally disable shields are classified as "strong" attacks, and inflict a longer cooldown (also configurable with a gamerule).
- Wither skeletons drop Witherbone, a new item which can also be crafted with bone, saltpeter, coal and charcoal.
  - Witherbone can be used to craft Wither Skeleton skulls, with 8 around a golden apple. Less tedious.
  - Witherbone can be used to craft Blaze Rods.
- Magma cream can be crafted by blasting magma blocks.

    <summary>Features for the next update? (Spoilers)</summary>
  <br>

- Coins. They can be signed, so you can limit their quantity, with different emblem options. (This is taking more time than expected, so please have some patience with this update)

- Totem Sickness, a new effect that can't be removed with a milk bucket. It applies when a player uses the Totem of Undying, and prevents it from being used until the effect wears off.
